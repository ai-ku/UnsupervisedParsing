NLTK will search for Penntree bank and Dependency files at various location (Read NLTK doc)
I have used /Users/husnusensoy/nltk_data/corpora/treebank for penntreebank (.mrg extension) and 
            /Users/husnusensoy/nltk_data/corpora/dependency_treebank for dependency graphs (.dp extension).

For more details refer to bitbucket wiki entry of the project.
